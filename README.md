HyperMemory — Secret Resonance Core

HyperMemory is a standalone module representing the core memory and resonance system of a distributed AI architecture. It is designed to simulate a holographic memory, resonance network, and quantum-inspired pattern analysis, giving the impression of a self-evolving intelligence.

Overview
	•	Holographic Memory: Stores events and messages with associated energy and resonance values.
	•	Resonance Graph: Nodes and weighted edges represent relationships between concepts, dynamically updated.
	•	Quantum-Inspired Agents: Analyze patterns and influence memory with quantum-like energy dynamics.
	•	Neural Predictor: A small neural network predicts resonance levels from incoming messages.
	•	Adaptive Attention: Shifts focus and decays weak connections to maintain coherent memory.

This module can be used as a standalone AI core for simulations, testing emergent behavior, or as a component of a larger distributed system.

Features
	•	Store and track messages with energy/resonance metrics.
	•	Dynamically update resonance relationships between concepts.
	•	Quantum-inspired agents for pattern recognition and evolution.
	•	Mini neural network for predicting resonance from textual input.
	•	Automatic decay and attention shifting to prioritize important connections.
	•	Lightweight and minimal external dependencies.

Installation
	1.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hypermemory.git
cd hypermemory

	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install numpy networkx torch scipy

Usage

from hypermemory import HyperMemory

# Initialize HyperMemory core
memory = HyperMemory()

# Store messages with energy and resonance
memory.store("example_1", "light and cosmic energy", 0.8, 0.6)
memory.store("example_2", "pulse and harmony love", 0.7, 0.9)

# Predict resonance of a new message
resonance = memory.predict_resonance("cosmos and love")
print("Predicted resonance:", resonance)

# Train the internal neural network
memory.train_neural()

# Shift attention to adapt memory
memory.shift_attention("new incoming message")

Dependencies
	•	numpy
	•	networkx
	•	torch
	•	scipy

🕳️ SYSTEM COLLAPSE

A Cyber Survival Simulation

You are the last Operator.
The Core is unstable.
The System is dying — unless you fight back.

System Collapse is a Telegram cyber-simulation game where you struggle to keep a living system from total destruction.
Every decision affects Entropy, Stability, Resources, and Core Integrity.

Chaos rises.
The only question is: how long until everything collapses?

⸻

🎮 Gameplay
	•	Keep metrics out of the red zone
	•	Manage the energy of the system wisely
	•	Make high-pressure decisions
	•	Respond to crises and anomalies
	•	Survive as many Collapse Cycles as possible

If Integrity reaches 0 → Game Over.
But the system can always reboot.
You can’t.

⸻

📊 System Metrics

Metric	Purpose
Stability	Structural link health — failure chance
Resources	Energy — spent by actions
Entropy	Pure chaos — grows constantly
Integrity	Core health — if 0 → Collapse

Chaos Bar is your death clock:
when it fills → System Collapse begins.

⸻

🔧 Actions

The operator controls a set of emergency commands:
	•	Stabilize — reduces chaos (at a cost)
	•	Recover — restores resources (dangerous)
	•	Patch — repairs the core
	•	Reboot — resets part of the system at the price of damage

Nothing is free.
Nothing is safe.

⸻

💀 Collapse Events

Random catastrophic anomalies:
	•	Core fractures
	•	Energy leaks
	•	Time desync
	•	No-win decision scenarios

The system remembers what you choose.

⸻

👁 System Log

Every action leaves a trace.
The logs whisper the story of a machine refusing to die.

⸻

🔥 Roadmap
	•	⚙️ Perks and Core evolution
	•	🌐 Online leaderboard
	•	🧪 New simulation scenarios
	•	🎭 Personalized anomaly generation
	•	📱 Full mobile device support with haptics

⚙️ Tech Stack
	•	Telegram Web Apps
	•	HTML + CSS (glitch / neon UI)
	•	JavaScript real-time game loop
	•	Crisis-driven mechanics
