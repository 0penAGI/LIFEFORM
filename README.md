🕳️ SYSTEM COLLAPSE

A Cyber Survival Simulation

You are the last Operator.
The Core is unstable.
The System is dying — unless you fight back.

System Collapse is a Telegram cyber-simulation game where you struggle to keep a living system from total destruction.
Every decision affects Entropy, Stability, Resources, and Core Integrity.

Chaos rises.
The only question is: how long until everything collapses?

⸻

🎮 Gameplay
	•	Keep metrics out of the red zone
	•	Manage the energy of the system wisely
	•	Make high-pressure decisions
	•	Respond to crises and anomalies
	•	Survive as many Collapse Cycles as possible

If Integrity reaches 0 → Game Over.
But the system can always reboot.
You can’t.

⸻

📊 System Metrics

Metric	Purpose
Stability	Structural link health — failure chance
Resources	Energy — spent by actions
Entropy	Pure chaos — grows constantly
Integrity	Core health — if 0 → Collapse

Chaos Bar is your death clock:
when it fills → System Collapse begins.

⸻

🔧 Actions

The operator controls a set of emergency commands:
	•	Stabilize — reduces chaos (at a cost)
	•	Recover — restores resources (dangerous)
	•	Patch — repairs the core
	•	Reboot — resets part of the system at the price of damage

Nothing is free.
Nothing is safe.

⸻

💀 Collapse Events

Random catastrophic anomalies:
	•	Core fractures
	•	Energy leaks
	•	Time desync
	•	No-win decision scenarios

The system remembers what you choose.

⸻

👁 System Log

Every action leaves a trace.
The logs whisper the story of a machine refusing to die.
